# lib<LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME>.dylib or <LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME>.lib.
#
# In order to use a library name that is not the same as the `EXPORT` (in the
# `install` command), it is necessary to pass the `FIRST_TARGET` option to
# `install_basic_package_files` in the main CMakeLists.txt file.
# In this case the project name is used for both, therefore it is not necessary.

# You can add an external dependency using the find_package() function call
# See: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html
# Note that the imported objects resulting from the find_package() depends upon
# the configuration files generated by the developer of the library.
# These imported objects can be either:
#  - variables that must be used to include directories and/or link libraries
#    with function calls like target_include_directories() and/or
#    target_link_libraries();
#  - a CMake target that must only be linked using target_link_libraries() and
#    CMake will take care of including and/or linking the appropriate
#    directories and/or libraries.
# See: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html
# See: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html
# For example:
# find_package(FooPackage) may import either
#  - variables: FooPackage_INCLUDE_DIRS and FooPackage_LIBRARIES
#  - target: FooPackage::FooPackage

# Adds a library target called ${LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME} to be built from the
# source and header files listed in the command invocation.

# - with imported target:
